# MIMIC-III Dataset

Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care – III (MIMIC-III) is an open-access database of 46,520 patients admitted at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts, between 2001 and 2012. Patient information, such as demographics, critical care unit records, hospital records, etc., has been stored in 26 linked tables as static (e.g., date of birth) and dynamic data (e.g., body temperature). Tables are mostly linked by identifiers with suffix ‘_ID’. For example, table ICUSTAYS has information on every ICU stay on the database. Each ICUSTAY_ID is linked to a single SUBJECT_ID (patient identifier) and single HADM_ID (hospital admission identifier).
Per the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the dataset was de-identified to protect patient privacy. Patients personal information such as names, contact information, etc. was excluded for the database. All dates in the dataset were randomly offset into the future, between the year 2100 and 2200, while maintaining the relative information consistent, such as time between the hospital admissions of a patient. Patients older than 89 years appear over 300 years old in the database.
